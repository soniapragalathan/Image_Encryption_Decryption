Image encryption and decryption involve transforming image data to protect it from unauthorized access.

**Image Encryption**
Image encryption converts an image into an unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms and a key. Methods include symmetric key encryption (e.g., AES) and asymmetric key encryption (e.g., RSA).

**Image Decryption**
Image decryption is the process of converting the encrypted image back to its original format using the corresponding key and algorithm.

**Applications**
Secure Storage: Protecting images on devices or cloud services.
Confidential Communication: Ensuring secure image transmission over networks.
Digital Watermarking: Embedding encrypted data in images for copyright protection.
